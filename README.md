## Installation

### Outlook

Go to [the add-in's page in the Office Store](https://store.office.com/de-de/app.aspx?assetid=WA104380335) and click the Add button. Once you have added the add-in to your online account it will automatically be available from within Outlook Desktop also. If Outlook Desktop is open when you add the add-in online, you need to close and re-open Outlook Desktop for the add-in to become available there.

### Thunderbird

In Thunderbird, go to Tools → Add-ons → Extensions and search for "Emoji" in the search box in the upper right-hand corner. In the result list, click Install on the right side.

You can also download the add-on from its [detail page at Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/thunderbird/addon/emojiaddin/) and then install using the [instructions here](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Extensions_(Thunderbird)).

Once you have installed the add-on and restarted Thunderbird, the add-on will be available in the toolbar and the View menu when you write a message.
